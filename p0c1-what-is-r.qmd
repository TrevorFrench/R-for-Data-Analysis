# What is R?

> R was a programming language that was designed specifically for the needs of statistics and data analysis. <br><br> -Hadley Wickham [@wickham21]

R is a statistical programming language used commonly for data analysis amongst other disciplines. It was built by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman at the University of Auckland and was first released in 1993.

## History

Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka "both had
an interest in statistical computing and saw a common
need for a better software environment in [their] Macintosh teaching laboratory. [They] saw no suitable commercial environment and [they] began to experiment to see what might be involved in developing one [them]selves." [@ihaka98]

While R was officially first released in 1993, it wasn't until 1995 that Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentlemann were convinced by  Martin MÃ¤chler to release the source code freely [@ihaka98].
