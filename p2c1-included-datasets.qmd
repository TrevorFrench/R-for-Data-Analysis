# Included Datasets

R comes with a variety of datasets already built in. This chapter will teach you how to view the catalog of included datasets, preview individual datasets, and begin working with the data.

## View Catalog

You can view a complete list of datsets available along with a brief description for each one by typing "data()" into your console.

```{r}
#| eval: false
data()
```

This will open a new tab in your R Studio instance that looks similar to the following image:

```{r out.extra="style='background-color: #9ecff7; padding:10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 90%;'"}
#| label: data
#| echo: false
#| out.width: 500
knitr::include_graphics("images/data-acquisition/data.png", dpi = 270)
```

## Working with Included Data

The first step to begin working with your chosen dataset is to load it into your environment by using the "data" function with the quoted name of your dataset inside the parentheses. In the following example, we'll attach the "iris" dataset to our environment.

It may not be necessary for you to load your dataset via the "data" function prior to using it. Additionally, some datasets may require you to add them to your search path by using using the "attach" function (conversely, you can remove datasets from your search path by using the "detach" function).
:::

```{r}
#| eval: false
data("iris")
```

This action will then give us a variable with the same name as our dataset which we can call as we would with any other data structure. Let's preview the "iris" dataset by using the "head" function.

```{r}
#| eval: false
head(iris)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::kable(head(iris), format="markdown")
```

Finally, you can view more information about any given dataset by typing the dataset name into the "Help" tab in the "Files" pane.

```{r out.extra="style='background-color: #9ecff7; padding:10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 90%;'"}
#| label: data-acq-1
#| echo: false
#| out.width: 500
knitr::include_graphics("images/data-acquisition/data-acq-1.png", dpi = 270)
```

## Common Datasets

Here are a few other commonly used datasets in the R community. These datasets are commonly used to practice and to teach.

### mtcars

```{r}
#| eval: false
head(mtcars)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::kable(head(mtcars), format="markdown")
```

### faithful

```{r}
#| eval: false
head(faithful)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::kable(head(faithful), format="markdown")
```

### ChickWeight

```{r}
#| eval: false
head(ChickWeight)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::kable(head(ChickWeight), format="markdown")
```

### Titanic

```{r}
head(Titanic)
```
