# R Markdown

R Markdown allows you to create documents in a programmatic fashion that lends itself towards reproducibility. This chapter will cover the different formats that are available in R as well as how to create them.

```{r out.extra="style='background-color: #9ecff7; padding:10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 40%;'"}
#| label: create-markdown
#| echo: false
#| out.width: 500
knitr::include_graphics("images/reporting/create-markdown.png", dpi = 270)
```
