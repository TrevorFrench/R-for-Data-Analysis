# What is Data Analysis

> I mean my definition is data science is like data
analysis by programming. Which of course begs the
question of what data analysis is, and so I think of
data analysis as really any activity where the input is
data and the output is understanding or knowledge or
insights. So I think of that pretty broadly. And then to
do data science you're not doing it by pointing and
clicking. You're doing it by writing some code in a
programming language. <br><br> -Hadley Wickham (https://sds-platform-private.s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/PT337-Transcript.pdf)
