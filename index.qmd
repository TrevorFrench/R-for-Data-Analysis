# Preface {.unnumbered}

The preface gives you, as the author, the opportunity to introduce yourself to your readers and explain to them why they should hear what you have to say. This is where you build credibility, so you should give some insight into how you got to be an expert on your subject. You can toot your own horn a bit here.

You should use a preface to spark curiosity about your content and draw readers in. Here, you speak directly about the purpose, creation, or importance of your book. How did your bookâ€™s genesis come about? What was the pain point you were seeking to address when you decided you wanted to write a book, and why is that important to your readers? The preface is where you explain the who, when, and where of it all.
