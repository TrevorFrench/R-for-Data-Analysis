    "text": "install-r-5 is duplicated need better images\n\n“There is synthesis when, in combining therein judgments that are made known to us from simpler relations, one deduces judgments from them relative to more complicated relations. There is analysis when from a complicated truth one deduces more simple truths.”  -André-Marie Ampère (Hofmann 1996)\n\nEveryone is a data analyst. The purpose of this book is to inspire and enable anyone who reads it to reconsider the methods they currently employ to analyse data. This is not to suggest that the methodologies outlined will be useful or sufficient for everyone who reads it. Some analyses can be performed quickly without the need for additional computation while others will require advanced analytics techniques not outlined in this book; however, the aspiration is that all will be equipped with novel tools and ideas for approaching data analysis.\n\n\nNo prior knowledge is required to begin this book. The content will start at the very beginning by showing you how to set up your R environment and the basics of programming in R. By the end of the book, you will be able to perform intermediate analytics techniques such as linear regresion and automatic report generation.\nYou will need an environment which you use to run your code. It is recommended that you download R and R Studio locally for this requirement. This book will walk you through how to do that as well as offer alternatives if that is not an option for you.\n\n\n\n\nPart I (Fundamentals) will introduce you to the basics of programming in the context of R.\nPart II (Data Acquisition) will teach you how to create, import, and access data.\nPart III (Data Preparation) will show you how to begin preparing your data for analysis.\nPart IV (Developing Insights) goes through the process of searching for and extracting insights from your data.\nPart V (Reporting) demonstrates how to wrap your analysis up by developing and automating reports.\n\nEach part will be concluded with practical exercises for you to test your skills.\n\n\n\n\nHofmann, J. R. 1996. Enlightenment and Electrodynamics. Cambridge University Press."

    "text": "I mean my definition is data science is like data analysis by programming. Which of course begs the question of what data analysis is, and so I think of data analysis as really any activity where the input is data and the output is understanding or knowledge or insights. So I think of that pretty broadly. And then to do data science you’re not doing it by pointing and clicking. You’re doing it by writing some code in a programming language.  -Hadley Wickham (Eremenko 2020)\nData analysis at it’s most simple form is the process of searching for meaning in data with the ultimate goal being to draw insight from that meaning."

    "text": "When working in most programming languages, you will generally have the option to execute code one of two ways:\n\nin the console\nin a script\n\n\n\nThe first way to run code is directly in the console. If you’re working in R Studio, you will access the console through the “console” pane.\nAlternatively, if you downloaded R to your personal computer, you will likely be able to search your machine for an app named “RGui” and access the console this way as well.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following example, the text “print(3+2)”” is typed into the console. The user then presses enter and sees the result: “[1] 5”.\n\nprint(3+2)\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nYou may be wondering what “[1]” represents. This is simply a line number in the console and can be ignored for most practical purposes. Additionally, most of the examples in this book will be structured in this way: formatted code immediately followed by the code output.\n\n\n\nYou likely will be using scripts most of the time when working in R. A script is just a file that allows you to type out longer sequences of code and execute them all at once.\nFor those of you following along in R Studio, you can create a script by pressing “Ctrl + Shift + N” on Windows or by selecting “R Script” from the “New File” dropdown in the top left corner.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom here you can type the same command from before into the source pane. Next, you’ll want to save your file by pressing “Ctrl + S” on Windows or by selecting “Save” from the “File” dropdown in the top left corner. Now just give your file a name and your file will automatically be saved as a “.R” file.\nFinally, run your newly created R script by pressing the “source” button."

    "text": "5.2 Comments\nComments are present in most (if not all) programming languages. They allow the user to write text in their code that isn’t executed or read by computers. Comments can serve many purposes such as notes, instructions, or formatting.\nComments are created in R by using the “#” symbol. Here’s an example:\n\n# This is a comment\nprint(3+2)\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nSome programming languages allow you a “bulk-comment” feature which allows you to quickly comment out multiple consecutive lines of text. However, in R, there is no such option. Each line must begin with a “#” symbol, as such:\n\n# This is the first line of a comment\n# This is the second line of a comment\nprint(3+2)\n\n[1] 5\n\n\nComments don’t have to start at the beginning of a line. You are able to start comments anywhere on a line like in this example:\n\nprint(3+2) # This comment starts mid-line\n\n[1] 5"

    "text": "2.1 The Process of Data Analysis\nThe process of data analysis can be generally described in six steps:\n\nGathering Requirements - Before one embarks on an analysis, it’s important to make sure the requirements are understood. Requirements include the questions which your stakeholders are hoping to answer as well as the technical requirements of how you are going to perform your analysis.\nData Acquisition - As you might imagine, you must acquire your data before conducting an analysis. This may be done through the methods such as manual creation of datasets, importing pre-constructed data, or leveraging APIs.\nData Preparation - Most data will not be received in the precise format you need to begin your analysis. The process of data preparation is where you will structure and add features to your data.\nDeveloping Insights - Once your data is prepared, you can now begin to make sense of your data and develop insights about it’s meaning.\nReporting - Finally, it’s important to report on your data in such a way that the information is able to be digested by the people who need to see it when they need to see it.\n\nOther sources may include additional steps such as “acting on the analysis”. While this is a critical step for organizations to capture the full value of their data, I would argue that it occurs outside of the analysis process.\nThis book will focus on the technical skills required to conduct an analysis. Because of this, we will be covering steps two through five."

Some of these tools include formatting your code and help with function definitions.\nCompile Report- This allows you to compile a report directly from an R script without needing to use additional frameworks such as R Markdown.\nRun Current Selection- This allows you to highlight a portion of your code and run only that portion.\nRe-run Previous Code Region- This option will execute the last section of code that you ran.\nGo to Previous/Next Section/Chunk- These up and down arrows allow you to navigate through sections of your code without needing to scroll.\nSource Contents- This option will save your active document if it isn’t already saved and then source the file.\nOutline- Pressing this option will pop open an outline of your current file.\nAdjust Frame Size- These two options will adjust the size of the source pane inside of R Studio.\nSyntax Highlighting- This allows you to adjust the syntax highlighting of your active document to match the highlighting of other file types.\n“Jump To” Menu- This menu allows you to quickly jump to different sections of your code.\nCursor Position- This displays your current cursor position by row and column.\nRow Numbers- The lef-thand side of your document will display the row number for each line of your code.\nBack/Forward- These arrows are navigation tools that will allow you to redo/undo the following actions: opening a document (or switching tabs), going to a function definition, jumping to a line, and jumping to a function using the function menu (Paulson 2022).\nTab- This is a tab in the traditional sense, meaning you are able to have a collection of documents open displayed as tabs. These tabs will have the title of your document and often an icon of some sort to demonstrate the file type."
