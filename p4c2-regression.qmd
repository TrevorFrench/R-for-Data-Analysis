# Regression

Regression is a common statistical technique employed by many to make generalizations as well as predictions about data.

## Linear Regression
lm(y~x)

A data frame with 272 observations on 2 variables.
 
[,1]	eruptions	numeric	Eruption time in mins
[,2]	waiting	numeric	Waiting time to next eruption (in mins)

```{r}
#| output: false
head(faithful)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::kable(head(faithful), format="markdown")
```

```{r}
lm <- lm(faithful$eruptions ~ faithful$waiting)
summary(lm)
```

Maybe plot trendline now similar to what was done in my medium article

## Multiple Regression
lm(y ~ x + x, data = input)

## Logistic Regression
glm(y ~ x, family = binomial, data = mtcars)
