# Outliers

Outliers are observations that fall outside the expected scope of the dataset. It's important to identify outliers in your data and determine the necessary treatment for them before moving into the next analysis phase.

might be necessary to impute value, remove row or may be necessary to keep the data besides extreme value

One common first step many people employ when looking for outliers is visualizing their datasets so that exterme values can be quickly identified.
