# Part II: Data Acquisition

As you might imagine, you must acquire your data before conducting an analysis. This may be done through the methods such as manual creation of datasets, importing pre-constructed data, or leveraging APIs.

- **Included Datasets**- R comes with a variety of datasets already built in. This chapter will teach you how to view the catalog of included datasets, preview individual datasets, and begin working with the data.
- **Import from Spreadsheets**- Most R users will have to work with spreadsheets at some point in their careers. This chapter will teach you how to import data from spreadsheets whether it's in a .csv or .xlsx file and get the imported data into a format that's easy to work with.
- **Working with APIs**- API stands for Application Programming Interface. These sorts of tools are commonly used to programmatically pull data from a third party resource. This chapter demonstrates how you can begin to leverage these tools in your own workflows.
