- **Getting Familiar with RStudio**- There are four sections in RStudio. These sections are often referred to as "panes". This chapter will introduce you to the "source", "console", "environment", and "files" panes. Additionally, you will learn about the different ways you can customize your version of RStudio such as changing the color scheme.
- **Programming Basics**- While the R language certainly has its unique advantages, it still leverages principles found in many other programming languages such as functions, comments, and loops. Learn how to apply these and other principles in R.
- **Data Types**- Data is stored differently depending on what it represents when programming. For example, a number and a letter are stored as different data types. Learn about the five basic data types in R and how to use them.
- **Data Structures**- In computer science, a data structure refers to the method which one uses to organize their data. Six basic data structures are commonly used in R. Learn about each of them in this chapter.
