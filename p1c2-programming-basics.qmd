# Programming Basics

## Executing Code

run selections rather than scripts

When working in most programming languages, you will generally have the option to execute code one of two ways:

- in the console
- in a script

### Console

The first way to run code is directly in the console. If you're working in R Studio, you will access the console through the "console" pane. 

Alternatively, if you downloaded R to your personal computer, you will likely be able to search your machine for an app named "RGui" and access the console this way as well.

```{r out.extra="style='background-color: #9ecff7; padding:10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 80%;'"}
#| label: RGui
#| echo: false
#| out.width: 500
knitr::include_graphics("images/programming-basics/RGui.png", dpi = 270)
```

In the following example, the text "print(3+2)"" is typed into the console. The user then presses enter and sees the result: "[1] 5".

```{r}
print(3+2)
```

You may be wondering what "[1]" represents. This is simply a line number in the console and can be ignored for most practical purposes. Additionally, most of the examples in this book will be structured in this way: formatted code immediately followed by the code output.

### Script

You likely will be using scripts most of the time when working in R. A script is just a file that allows you to type out longer sequences of code and execute them all at once.

For those of you following along in R Studio, you can create a script by pressing "Ctrl + Shift + N" on Windows or by selecting "R Script" from the "New File" dropdown in the top left corner.

```{r out.extra="style='background-color: #9ecff7; padding:10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 80%;'"}
#| label: source-pane-2
#| echo: false
#| out.width: 500
knitr::include_graphics("images/r-studio/source-pane-2.png", dpi = 270)
```

From here you can type the same command from before into the source pane. Next, you'll want to save your file by pressing "Ctrl + S" on Windows or by selecting "Save" from the "File" dropdown in the top left corner. Now just give your file a name and your file will automatically be saved as a ".R" file.

Finally, run your newly created R script by pressing the "source" button.

```{r out.extra="style='background-color: #9ecff7; padding:10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 80%;'"}
#| label: script-1
#| echo: false
#| out.width: 500
knitr::include_graphics("images/programming-basics/script-1.png", dpi = 270)
```

## Comments

Comments are present in most (if not all) programming languages. They allow the user to write text in their code that isn't executed or read by computers. Comments can serve many purposes such as notes, instructions, or formatting.

Comments are created in R by using the "#" symbol. Here's an example:

```{r}
# This is a comment
print(3+2)
```

Some programming languages allow you a "bulk-comment" feature which allows you to quickly comment out multiple consecutive lines of text. However, in R, there is no such option. Each line must begin with a "#" symbol, as such:

```{r}
# This is the first line of a comment
# This is the second line of a comment
print(3+2)
```

Comments don't have to start at the beginning of a line. YOu are able to start comments anywhere on a line like in this example:

```{r}
print(3+2) # This comment starts mid-line
```
