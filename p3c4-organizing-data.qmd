# Organizing Data

This chapter will focus on sorting, filtering, and grouping your datasets.

## Sorting
Student Scores dataset sort highest to lowest, alphabetical, lowest to highest, random sort.

sort() vs order() vs rank()

```{r}
#| output: false
head(ChickWeight)
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::kable(head(ChickWeight), format="markdown")
```

```{r}
df <- ChickWeight
df <- df[order(df$weight),]
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::kable(head(df), format="markdown")
```

```{r}
df <- ChickWeight
df <- df[order(-df$weight),]
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::kable(head(df), format="markdown")
```

## Filtering
Filter by grades higher or lower than a certain number, where name starts with or is equal to a value, do an or/and statement.

## Grouping
Add a column that indicates whether each student is male or female and group by gender. Then run stats based off of grouping.
