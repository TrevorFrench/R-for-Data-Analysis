# Spreadsheets

Spreadsheets are common way to communicate information to stakeholders. This chapter will go over how to export .xlsx and .csv files from R, how to format those spreadsheets, and how to add formulas to them.

### Export .xlsx Files

Excel files are handled very similarly to CSV files with the exception being that you will need to use the "write_excel" function from the "writexl" library. The following code snippet demonstrates how to export your data to an Excel file.

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(writexl)
output <- "C:/File Location/example.xlsx"
people <- c("John", "Jane")
id <- c(1, 2)
df <- data.frame(id = id, person = people)
write_xlsx(df, output)
```
