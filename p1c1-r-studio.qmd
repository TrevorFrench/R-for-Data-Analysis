# Getting Familiar with R Studio

To begin, we are going to walkthrough how to customize your version of R Studio to make it the most comfortable environment for you personally. Following this, we are going to walk through the four panes of R Studio. At a glance, R Studio may seem overwhelming; however, by the end of this chapter you will have learned the essentials.

## Customization

You are able to customize how your version of R Studio looks by following these steps:

1. Open R Studio and choose ‘tools’ from the toolbar

```{r out.extra="style='background-color: #9ecff7; padding:10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 80%;'"}
#| label: customize-r-studio-1
#| echo: false
#| out.width: 500
knitr::include_graphics("images/customize-r-studio/customize-r-studio-1.png", dpi = 270)
```

2. Choose ‘Global Options’

```{r out.extra="style='background-color: #9ecff7; padding:10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 50%;'"}
#| label: customize-r-studio-2
#| echo: false
#| out.width: 500
knitr::include_graphics("images/customize-r-studio/customize-r-studio-2.png", dpi = 270)
```

3. Choose ‘Appearance’ and select your favorite theme from the ‘Editor Theme’ section

```{r out.extra="style='background-color: #9ecff7; padding:10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 80%;'"}
#| label: customize-r-studio-3
#| echo: false
#| out.width: 500
knitr::include_graphics("images/customize-r-studio/customize-r-studio-3.png", dpi = 270)
```

4. Press ‘Apply’

There are other customization options avaialable as well. Feel free to explore the "Global Options" section to make your version of R Studio your own.

## Source Pane

The source pane is the top left pane in R Studio. This is where you will write and edit your code.

```{r out.extra="style='background-color: #9ecff7; padding:10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 80%;'"}
#| label: source-pane-1
#| echo: false
#| out.width: 500
knitr::include_graphics("images/r-studio/source-pane-1.png", dpi = 270)
```

If you don't see the source pane, you may need to create a new R Script by pressing “Ctrl + Shift + N” ("Cmd + Shift + N" on Mac) or by selecting “R Script” from the “New File” dropdown in the top left corner.

```{r out.extra="style='background-color: #9ecff7; padding:10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 80%;'"}
#| label: source-pane-2
#| echo: false
#| out.width: 500
knitr::include_graphics("images/r-studio/source-pane-2.png", dpi = 270)
```

Each element of the source pane is outlined below.

```{r out.extra="style='background-color: #9ecff7; padding:10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 90%;'"}
#| label: source-pane-3
#| echo: false
#| out.width: 500
knitr::include_graphics("images/r-studio/source-pane-3.png", dpi = 270)
```

a. **Show in New Window**- This allows you to pop the source pane into a new window by itself.
b. **Save Current Document**- This saves the file contained in the tab you currently have active.
c. **Source on Save**- Automatically sources your file every time you hit save. "Sourcing" is similar to "Running" in the sense that both will execute your code; however, sourcing will execute your saved file rather than sticking lines of code into the console.
d. **Find/Replace**- this feature allows you to find and replace specified text, similar to find and replace features in other tools such as Excel.
e. **Code Tools**- This brings up a menu of options which help you to code more efficiently. Some of these tools include formatting your code and help with function definitions.
f. **Compile Report**- This allows you to compile a report directly from an R script without needing to use additional frameworks such as R Markdown.
g. **Run Current Selection**- This allows you to highlight a portion of your code and run only that portion.
h. **Re-run Previous Code Region**- This option will execute the last section of code that you ran.
i. **Go to Previous/Next Section/Chunk**- These up and down arrows allow you to navigate through sections of your code without needing to scroll.
j. **Source Contents**- This option will save your active document if it isn't already saved and then source the file.
k. Outline- Pressing this option will pop open an outline of your current file.
l. **Adjust Frame Size**- These two options will adjust the size of the source pane inside of R Studio.
m. **Syntax Highlighting**- This allows you to adjust the syntax highlighting of your active document to match the highlighting of other file types.
n. **"Jump To" Menu**- This menu allows you to quickly jump to different sections of your code.
o. **Cursor Position**- This displays your current cursor position by row and column.
p. **Row Numbers**- The lef-thand side of your document will display the row number for each line of your code.
q. **Back/Forward**- These arrows are navigation tools that will allow you to redo/undo the following actions: opening a document (or switching tabs), going to a function definition, jumping to a line, and jumping to a function using the function menu [@paulson22].
r. **Tab**- This is a tab in the traditional sense, meaning you are able to have a collection of documents open displayed as tabs. These tabs will have the title of your document and often an icon of some sort to demonstrate the file type.

## Console

The console pane is the bottom left pane in R Studio. This pane has three tabs: "Console", "Terminal", and "Background Jobs".

- The "Console" tab is where you will be able to run R code directly without writing a script (this will be covered in the next chapter).

- The "Terminal" tab is the same terminal you have on your computer. This can be adjusted in the global options.

- The "Background Jobs" tab is where you can start and manage processes that need to run behind the scenes.

```{r out.extra="style='background-color: #9ecff7; padding:10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 80%;'"}
#| label: console-pane-1
#| echo: false
#| out.width: 500
knitr::include_graphics("images/r-studio/console-pane-1.png", dpi = 270)
```

## Environment

The environment pane is the top right pane in R Studio. This is where you will manage all things related to your development environment.

```{r out.extra="style='background-color: #9ecff7; padding:10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 80%;'"}
#| label: env-pane-1
#| echo: false
#| out.width: 500
knitr::include_graphics("images/r-studio/env-pane-1.png", dpi = 270)
```

## Files

The files pane is the bottom right pane in R Studio.

```{r out.extra="style='background-color: #9ecff7; padding:10px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; width: 80%;'"}
#| label: files-pane-1
#| echo: false
#| out.width: 500
knitr::include_graphics("images/r-studio/files-pane-1.png", dpi = 270)
```
