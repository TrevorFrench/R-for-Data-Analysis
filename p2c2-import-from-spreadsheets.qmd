# Import from Spreadsheets

Most R users will have to work with spreadsheets at some point in their careers. This chapter will teach you how to import data from spreadsheets whether it's in a .csv or .xlsx file and get the imported data into a format that's easy to work with.

## Import from .csv Files

```{r}
#| eval: false
input <- "C:/File Location/example.csv"
df <- read.csv(input)
```

## Import from .xlsx Files

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(readxl)
input <- "C:/File Location/example.xlsx"
df <- read_excel(input)
```
